The SPREAD language adds three additional concepts to a standard Spreadheet:

1) Instead of one single value, a cell can have more alternative values: a Set of values
2) Next to Numbers, Strings, Dates, etc, there is an additional cell type: the 'Spreadsheet'
3) A cell can be named or 'Labeled' with anything, Numbers, Strings, Dates ... and spreadsheets!
